This is my first app where I did both frontend and backend
### Website

### Tools used
- React
- Apollo
- GraphQL
- MongoDB

### Responsive Design
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Example: below md and above md screens
![xs screens and above](./client/src/pictures/xs.png)
![md screens and above](./client/src/pictures/md.png)
### Functionalities
- getting, adding, updating and deleting tasks
### Things I learned
